## Color Swatch Challenge

Instead of paginated data, I chose to use Material-UI's GridList / GridTile components. This created a box of my size choice with scrolling, which I thought was more modern than pagination. The tiles scroll through all 100 swatches, but the rest of the page is static. I got the view to change onClick, although I didn't quite get it to do what I wanted it to do. I didn't feel I had several entirely devoted and uninterrupted days to dedicate to the project because of being a Teachers Assistant full time, and I feel that I would have accomplished the detail view completely if I had.

I was able to replicate the design with font, styles, and iconography, and replicate most of the functionality.

## Deliverables

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to work on this, it was a lot of fun!
